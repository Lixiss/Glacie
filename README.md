## glacie-checkdb

Go into `src/glacie-checkdb` directory. Run `dotnet run -- "<path-to-database>"`. This path should point to database (extracted) directory.
E.g. if you have `my-cool-mod` in working directory which built by ArtManager - you should put path to database directory inside.
E.g. `<somewhere>\Working\my-cool-mod\database`. Note, this tool do lookup only in files under this directory.
